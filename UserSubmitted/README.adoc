## Submitting your own models
If you want to submit your own models, please follow these guidelines:

* Create a folder within `/UserSubmitted` with your name or some other identifier (e.g. `/UserSubmitted/Cris`). All your models will be placed inside this folder
* You can add subfolders within your folder if you want to add multiple designs (e.g. `/UserSubmitted/Cris/Base`, `/UserSubmitted/Cris/Sensor`, etc)
* Add a readme file. Please include (at least) the following:
    ** Introduction: What does your design do or how is it different from other designs
    ** Bill of materials: A list of everything that's required to build the design. Preferably this would include product numbers, links or search terms. Include clear pictures (maybe with dimensions) if you do not have a product number.
    ** Print requirements: Any special print requirements (layer height, material, printer type, etc).
    ** Assembly instructions: Step-by-step instructions on how to assemble the design, preferably with lots of pictures.
    ** Contact information: Name, email, etc
* If you have multiple designs, you would preferably have multiple readme files, one for each design (it would be good to separate your designs into multiple folders)
* Give your designs a sensible name
* Add at least a `.stl` file and preferably also a `.step` or `.obj` file
* Add your design to the index above. Please note that the file format of this readme is AsciiDoc, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[here] for more info. Images that go in the table must be located in `UserSubmitted/Img`
* The repository is licensed under an open source MIT license. If you do not provide a separate license, your designs will also fall under the MIT license. You can add your own `LICENSE` file if you want

You can then do a pull request.
