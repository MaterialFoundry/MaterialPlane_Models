Since I mostly use LEGO Minifigures for Pen and Paper I edited the base files a bit. Tolerances came out perfectly with my Bambu X1 with Yayo PLA filament.

Bill of material for 1 set:
- 1x	Base_Brick_Cover
- 1x	Base_Brick_Magnet
- 3x	Magnet (3mm diameter, 2mm thickness)
- electronics as per Cris' design.

Instructions:
- Cover
	- Print with the fully flat side pointed downwards.
	- Add 3 magnets (3mm diameter, 2mm thickness) to each cover.
	- Make sure the magnets are switched. One should show up with N, two should show up with S (or vice versa).
	- The magnets shouldn't need glue. Use pliers to press them into the holes.
	- Add felt on the outside.
- Base
	- Print with the studs pointed downwards. Supports are not needed. Maybe you might need some Brim.
	- Add 3 magnets (3mm diameter, 2mm thickness) to each base.
	- Same as the Cover, make sure the magnets are not all in the same direction. Also make sure they are placed correctly in regards to the corresponding Cover.
	- Order 2x2 Turntable Plates somewhere. They are pretty cheap on Aliexpress. 
	- Push them onto the studs (Use pliers again if needed). Your figures can now change direction without moving the bases. 

- Tip
	- Make one set of Cover and Base first. Orient magnets for further sets exactly the same. This way the figures will attach to each other instead of pushing themselves apart.

My changes to base design by Cris:
- Added a cover that is held in place by magnets. It cannot be attached wrong. It also has a recess for easier seperation (e.g. when changing battery).
- Added 2x2 LEGO compatible studs. You might attach a 2x2 Turntable Plate there.
- Made the opening for the IR LED slightly smaller.
